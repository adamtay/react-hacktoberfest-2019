            Auckland (/ˈɔːklənd/ AWK-lənd) is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. The most populous urban area
            in the country, Auckland has an urban population of around 1,628,900 (June 2018).[4] It is located in the
            Auckland Region—the area governed by Auckland Council—which includes outlying rural areas and the islands
            of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of 1,695,900.[4] Auckland is a diverse, multicultural
            and cosmopolitan city, home to the largest Polynesian population in the world.[5] A Māori-language name for
            Auckland is Tāmaki ([ˈtaːmaki]) or Tāmaki Makaurau, meaning "Tāmaki with a hundred lovers", in reference to
            the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions.[6]
